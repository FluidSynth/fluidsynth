New features
------------
- Audio level metering
- Active voice count monitoring

Synthesis
---------
- Improve voice stealing algorithm
- Dynamic voice killing (based on CPU usage)
- Batch voice activation (stereo synch. as per SoundFont spec)
- Pitch control on stereo samples not managed as should

Drivers
-------
- libao audio output driver
- Windows DirectMusic component
- ASIO driver
- DirectSound 3D and EAX

Bugs to mash
------------
- Investigate why MIDI rendering causes burst of notes at start

Validation
----------
- Validation tests: create soundfont with basic wave forms [sine,
  square, triangle]; make test midi file; compare with SBLive output;
  "regression" test
- Validate chorus (often sounds rather crappy)
- Analyse performance

Documentation
-------------
- Write documention on tuning
- Add usage scenarios in the documentation
- User and system configuration file

Misc
----
- Remove dependency of settings on audio driver and other (see
  fluid_settings_init())
- When specifying -i -s (no console and TCP server) log to TCP clients
  with easier parsable messages ("warning:", "error:", etc)
- Pause and resume the synthesizer/audio thread (run synthesizer as a daemon)
- set loop on/off on a sample (set_gen GEN_SAMPLEMODE?)


FluidSynth Next Generation
--------------------------------------------

Top of the list
- 3D audio output

MIDI player
- Add API to manipulate and query MIDI file list
- generalize use of fluid_event_t, remove fluid_midi_event_t

Shell & command handler
- Add "note" command that plays a note with a duration (sequencer)
- MIDI file player commands (load/play/stop)
- Allow settings to be loaded before the synthesizer is created

MIDI Specs
- sample dump
- MIDI thru
- Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI)


Unsorted
- rewrite midi file using new sequencer
