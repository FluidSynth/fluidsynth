\section Abstract

<a href="http://www.fluidsynth.org">FluidSynth</a> is a software synthesizer based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont">SoundFont 2</a> specifications. The synthesizer is available as a shared object that can easily be reused in any application that wants to use wave-table synthesis. This document explains the basic usage of FluidSynth. Some of the more advanced features are not yet discussed but will be added in future versions.

\page Introduction Introduction

What is FluidSynth?

- FluidSynth is a software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications. The synthesizer is available as a shared object (a concept also named Dynamic Linking Library, or DLL) that can be easily reused in any application for wave-table synthesis. This document explains the basic usage of FluidSynth.

- FluidSynth provides a Command Line Interface program ready to be used from the console terminal, offering most of the library functionalities to end users, among them the ability of render and play Standard MIDI Files, receive real-time MIDI events from external hardware ports and other applications, perform advanced routing of such events, enabling at the same time a local shell as well as a remote server commands interface.

- FluidSynth is an API (Application Programming Interface) relieving programmers from a lot of details of reading SoundFont and MIDI events and files, and sending the digital audio output to a Sound Card. These tasks can be accomplished using a small set of functions. This document explains most of the API functions and gives short examples about them.

- FluidSynth uses instrument samples contained in standard SF2 (SoundFont 2) files, having a file structure based on the RIFF format. The specification is publicly available on the internet, but most users don't need to know any details of the format.

- FluidSynth can easily be embedded in an application. It has a main header file, fluidsynth.h, and one dynamically linkable library. FluidSynth runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and the Windows platforms, and support for OS/2 and OpenSolaris is experimental. It has audio and midi drivers for all mentioned platforms but you can use it with your own drivers if your application already handles MIDI and audio input/output. This document explains the basic usage of FluidSynth and provides examples that you can reuse. 

- FluidSynth is open source, in active development. For more details, take a look at http://www.fluidsynth.org

This page contains functions that have been marked obsolete.
Functions listed here will be removed in the next major release.
It is therefore not wise to use them in new code.
