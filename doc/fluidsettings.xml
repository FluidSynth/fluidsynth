                This score is divided by the number of seconds this voice has been

                This setting is a comma-separated list of MIDI channel numbers that should
                be treated as "important" by the overflow calculation, adding the score
                set by synth.overflow.important to each voice on those channels. It can
                be used to make voices on particular MIDI channels
                less likely (synth.overflow.important &gt; 0) or more likely
                (synth.overflow.important &lt; 0) to be killed in an overflow situation. Channel
                numbers are 1-based, so the first MIDI channel is number 1.

                Sets the overflow priority score added to voices on a percussion
                channel. This is usually a positive score, to give percussion voices
                a higher priority and less chance of being killed in an overflow
                situation.

                Sets the overflow priority score added to voices that have already
                received a note-off event. This is usually a negative score, to give released
                voices a lower priority so that they are killed first in an overflow
                situation.

                Sets the overflow priority score added to voices that are currently
                sustained. With the default value, sustained voices are considered less
                important and are more likely to be killed in an overflow situation.

                Sets the overflow priority score added to voices based on their current
                volume. The voice volume is normalized to a value between 0 and 1 and
                multiplied with this setting. So voices with maximum volume get added
                the full score, voices with only half that volume get added half of this
                score.

                The polyphony defines how many voices can be played in parallel. A note event produces one or more voices. Its good to set this to a value which the system can handle and will thus limit FluidSynth's CPU usage. When FluidSynth runs out of voices it will begin terminating lower priority voices for new note events.</desc>
