                Sets the number of synthesis CPU cores. If set to a value greater than 1, additional synthesis threads will be created to do the actual rendering work that is then returned synchronously by the render function. This has the affect of utilizing more of the total CPU for voices or decreasing render times when synthesizing audio.
                So for example, if you set cpu-cores to 4, fluidsynth will attempt to split the synthesis work it needs to do between the client's calling thread and three additional (internal) worker threads. As soon as all threads have done their work, their results are collected and the resulting buffer is returned to the caller.

This involves memory allocation, which is not realtime safe! So only enable this in non-realtime scenarios! E.g. when rendering to a WAVE file using the fast-file-renderer.

                This setting specifies the behavior for releasing voices, if the same note is hit twice on the same channel. Early synthesizers like the Roland SC-55 and Microsoft Wavetable GS MIDI synthesizer (MSGS) are terminating notes abruptly that have already received a noteOff after receiving a noteOn for the same key. This behavior was presumably implemented to save polyphony in these systems. This setting was introduced in fluidsynth 2.4.3 and can be enabled to mimic this behavior, to esp. play back old tunes like Doom E1M1 more accurately. Please note that using a SoundFont which makes proper use of exclusive classes for esp. percussion instruments will yield a similar or better result. Also, this approach is generally preferable because it's portable among SF2 compliant synths and can be applied more fine-grained among instruments. This setting supports the following values:
                <ul>
                    <li>0: A regular noteOff is applied to the previous note, which is the default SF2 compliant behavior.</li>
                    <li>1: Note-cut is only applied on drum MIDI channels (i.e. CHANNEL_TYPE_DRUM). Fluidsynth 2.4.0, 2.4.1, and 2.4.2 unconditionally used this mode.</li>
                    <li>2: Note-cut is applied to both, drum and melodic MIDI channels (i.e. CHANNEL_TYPE_DRUM and CHANNEL_TYPE_MELODIC).</li>

                This score is divided by the number of seconds this voice has been
                active and is added to the overflow priority. It is usually a positive
                value and gives voices which have just been started a higher priority,
                making them less likely to be killed in an overflow situation.

                set by synth.overflow.important to each voice on those channels. It can
                be used to make voices on particular MIDI channels
                less likely (synth.overflow.important &gt; 0) or more likely
                (synth.overflow.important &lt; 0) to be killed in an overflow situation. Channel
                numbers are 1-based, so the first MIDI channel is number 1.

                multiplied with this setting. So voices with maximum volume get added
                the full score, voices with only half that volume get added half of this
                score.

                The polyphony defines how many voices can be played in parallel. A note event produces one or more voices. Its good to set this to a value which the system can handle and will thus limit FluidSynth's CPU usage. When FluidSynth runs out of voices it will begin terminating lower priority voices for new note events.</desc>

                Sets the stereo spread of the reverb signal. A value of 0 indicates no stereo-separation causing the reverb to sound like a monophonic signal. A value of 1 indicates maximum separation between the uncorrelated left and right channels (note that reverb is still a monophonic effect). This subrange [0;1] is recommended for general usage. Values bigger than 1 increase (or exaggerate) the perception of the uncorrelated left and right signals. Otherwise, this setting should be considered as dimensionless quantity, with its maximum value existing for historical reasons. Please note that under some circumstances, values bigger than 1 may induce a feedback into the signal which can be perceived as unpleasant.</desc>

				The sample rate of the audio generated by the synthesizer. For optimal performance,
				make sure this value equals the native output rate of the audio driver (in case you
				are using any of FluidSynth's audio drivers). Some drivers, such as Oboe, will
				interpolate sample rates, whereas others, such as JACK, will override this setting
				if a mismatch with the native output rate is detected.
				<br /><br />
				Important: This setting should not be changed during runtime of the synthesizer.
				<br /><br />
				The sample rate is applied when the synthesizer is created and controls the
				rate at which samples are synthesized. Changing this value after creating the
				synthesizer does not affect the synthesizer. Audio drivers created later may use
				the updated setting value and cause the audio to play out of tune. If you need to
				change the sample rate, recreate both the synthesizer and the audio driver using
				settings with the new sample rate.

                This is the number of audio samples most audio drivers will request from the synth at one time. In other words, it's the amount of samples the synth is allowed to render in one go when no state changes (events) are about to happen. Because of that, specifying too big numbers here may cause MIDI events to be poorly quantized (=untimed) when a MIDI driver or the synth's API directly is used, as fluidsynth cannot determine when those events are to arrive. This issue does not matter, when using the MIDI player or the MIDI sequencer, because in this case, fluidsynth does know when events will be received.

            <desc>
                This setting is a comma-separated integer list that maps fluidsynth mono-channels
                to CoreAudio device output channels. Each position in the list represents the output channel
                of the CoreAudio device.
                The value of each position indicates the zero-based index of the fluidsynth
                output mono-channel to route there (i.e. the buffer index used for fluid_synth_process()).
                Additionally, the special value of -1 will turn off an output.
                <br /><br />
                For example, the default map for a single stereo output is "0,1". A value of "0,0" will
                copy the left channel to the right, a value of "1,0" will flip left and right, and a
                value of "-1,1" will play only the right channel.
                <br /><br />
                With a six-channel output device, and the synth.audio-channels and synth.audio-groups
                settings both set to "2", a channel map of "-1,-1,0,1,2,3" will result in notes from odd
                MIDI channels (audible on the first stereo channel, i.e. mono-indices 0,1) being sent to
                outputs 3 and 4, and even MIDI channels (audible on the second stereo channel, i.e. mono-indices 2,3)
                being sent to outputs 5 and 6.
                <br /><br />
                If the list specifies less than the number of available outputs channels, outputs
                beyond those specified will maintain the default channel mapping given by the CoreAudio driver.

                Device to use for WASAPI driver output. Starting with 2.3.6 all device names are expected to be UTF8 encoded.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Note</strong><br />
                When using the WASAPI audio driver, more detailed information about device and format negotiation (e.g. whether the requested format was accepted natively, adjusted, or rejected) may be obtained by installing a custom log callback using <code>fluid_set_log_function()</code>.
                <br />
                The WASAPI driver reports informational, warning, and error messages received from the OS during device initialization, which can be used as a best-effort heuristic to distinguish between:
                <ul>
                <li>Successful native opens,</li>
                <li>successful opens with format adjustment or resampling, and</li>
                <li>failed opens.</li>
                </ul>
                This mechanism is used internally by the <code>fluidsynth -Q</code> command, see <a href="https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/blob/master/src/fluid_wasapi_device_enumerate.c"><code>fluid_wasapi_device_enumerate.c</code></a> for a reference implementation. The content and meaning of log messages are not part of the public API contract and may change between releases.

            <desc>
                By default, WASAPI will operate in shared mode. Set it to 1 (TRUE) to use WASAPI in exclusive mode. In this mode, you'll benefit from direct soundcard access via kernel streaming, which has an extremely low latency. However, you must pay close attention to other settings, such as synth.sample-rate and audio.sample-format as your soundcard may not accept any possible sample configuration.
