\section NewIn2_2_0 What's new in 2.2.0?

- #fluid_file_callbacks_t now uses <code>long long</code> as file-offset type (see #fluid_long_long_t). This is a breaking change, which allows to load SoundFonts bigger than 2GiB on Windows. This change required to bump fluidsynth's SOVERSION.
- fluid_event_any_control_change() has been removed
- various fluid_event_*() functions that received a "value" argument of type <code>short</code> now receive an <code>int</code> argument in preparation for MIDI 2.0 support
- The sequencer has received a major revisal. For you that means:
  - The sequencer's queue no longer blocks the synthesizer thread, due to being busy arranging its events internally.
  - Events that share the same tick was given a new, documented order, see fluid_sequencer_send_at().
  - The sequencer's scale can now be used for arbitrary tempo changes. Previously, the scale of the sequencer was limited to 1000. The only limitation now is >0.
  - There is now a dedicated event type for changing the sequencer's time scale, see fluid_event_scale().
- The dynamic-sample-loader has learned support to pin samples, see fluid_synth_pin_preset() and fluid_synth_unpin_preset()
- Added getter and setter functions for individual effect groups
- Support for UTF-8 filenames under Windows, see fluid_synth_sfload()
- MIDI Tempo of the fluid_player can now be overridden, see fluid_player_set_tempo()

\section NewIn2_1_4 What's new in 2.1.4?

- a regression introduced in 2.1.3 broke fluid_synth_start() for DLS presets

\section NewIn2_1_1 What's new in 2.1.1?

- requirements for explicit sequencer client unregistering have been relaxed: delete_fluid_sequencer() now correctly frees any registered sequencer clients (clients can still be explicitly unregistered)
- using the sequencer with the system timer as timing source has been deprecated

\section NewIn2_1_0 What's new in 2.1.0?

- <span style="color:red">refrain from using fluid_synth_set_sample_rate()</span>
- \setting{synth_sample-rate} is no real-time setting anymore, see note about fluid_synth_set_sample_rate()
- new reverb engine
- chorus is now stereophonic
- smallest allowed chorus speed is now 0.1 Hz (previously 0.29 Hz)
- the following audio drivers were added:
  - opensles
  - oboe
  - sdl2
  - waveout

\section NewIn2_0_8 What's new in 2.0.8?

- fluid_sample_set_sound_data() caused broken sound when copying sample data

\section NewIn2_0_7 What's new in 2.0.7?

- fluid_free() has been added to allow proper deallocation by programming languages other than C/C++

\section NewIn2_0_6 What's new in 2.0.6?

- the MIDI player did not emit any audio when calling fluid_player_play() after fluid_player_stop()

\section NewIn2_0_5 What's new in 2.0.5?

- fluid_synth_process() omitted audio samples when called with arbitrary sample counts that were not a multiple of fluid_synth_get_internal_bufsize()
- fluid_synth_sfunload() was not releasing sample buffers of SoundFont3 files if \setting{synth_dynamic-sample-loading} was set to FALSE

\section NewIn2_0_3 What's new in 2.0.3?

- fix incorrect behaviour of fluid_sample_set_sound_data()
- add missing getters for midi events:
  - fluid_midi_event_get_text()
  - fluid_midi_event_get_lyrics()

\section NewIn2_0_2 What's new in 2.0.2?

- fluid_synth_error() has been deprecated, use fluid_set_log_function() to interfere log messages

\section NewIn2_0_0 What's new in 2.0.0?

FluidSynths major version was bumped. The API was reworked, deprecated functions were removed.

<strong><span style="color:red">Important changes that may not result in a compilation error but may cause your app to misbehave:</span></strong>

- all public \c fluid_settings_* functions that return an integer which is not meant to be interpreted as bool consistently return either FLUID_OK or FLUID_FAILED
- fluid_settings_setstr() cannot be used to set integer (toggle) settings with "yes" or "no" values anymore. Use fluid_settings_setint() instead, for example: <br /><code>fluid_settings_setint(settings, "synth.reverb.active", 0)</code> instead of <code>fluid_settings_setstr(settings, "synth.reverb.active", "no")</code>
- <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">explicit client unregistering is required for fluid_sequencer_register_client() and fluid_sequencer_register_fluidsynth()</span> (since fluidsynth 2.1.1 not required anymore, but still recommend)
- all public functions consistently receive signed integers for soundfont ids, bank and program numbers
- use unique device names for the \setting{audio_portaudio_device} setting
- fluid_synth_process() received a new more flexible implementation, but now requires zeroed-out sample buffers

<strong>Other changes in FluidSynth 2.0.0 concerning developers:</strong>

- all public \c delete_* functions return void and are safe when called with NULL
- the shell command handler was decoupled internally, as a consequence the param list of new_fluid_server() and new_fluid_cmd_handler() was adapted
- \c fluid_settings_set* functions no longer silently register unknown settings but return an error instead
- reverb: roomsize is now limited to an upper threshold of 1.0 to avoid exponential volume increase
- rename \c fluid_mod_new() and \c fluid_mod_delete() to match naming conventions: new_fluid_mod() and delete_fluid_mod()
- rename chorus getters to match naming conventions: fluid_synth_get_chorus_speed() and fluid_synth_get_chorus_depth()
- fluid_synth_remove_sfont() returns FLUID_OK or FLUID_FAILED
- introduce a separate data type for sequencer client IDs: #fluid_seq_id_t
- fluid_get_userconf() has been implemented for Windows

<strong>New Features and API additions:</strong>

- add \setting{midi_autoconnect} a setting for automatically connecting fluidsynth to available MIDI input ports
