     * (probably) meant here is that the filter does not show a
     * resonance hump for q_dB=0. In this case, the corresponding
     * q_lin is 1/sqrt(2)=0.707.  The filter should have 3 dB of
     * attenuation at fc now.  In this case Q_dB is the height of the

     * response of a non-resonant filter.  This idea is implemented as
